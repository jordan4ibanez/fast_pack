# fast_pack
 A fast texture packer for D built on top of potpack.

This is built off of: https://github.com/mapbox/potpack

Translated to D and reworked slightly.

Note: Image trimming has been removed in this version, I didn't use it, I don't think anyone used it.

The implementation has been supercharged and simplified in this version.

Here is a development screenshot I found fun. (Running in raylib-d)
